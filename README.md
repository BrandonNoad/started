# The STARTED Framework

The newly developed STARTED (**STA**ndards for **R**igor and **T**ranspar**E**ncy in **D**ysphagia Research) Framework is an evidence-based, preferred set of recommendations for reporting dysphagia research involving human subjects. This interactive, web-based application has been designed to appraise the rigor and transparency of peer-reviewed dysphagia articles. The application allows clinicians and researchers alike to easily determine strengths and weaknesses in design and/or reporting of dysphagia research by asking key questions to assess rigor and transparency across the following categories:

-   Participants and baseline characteristics
-   Non-instrumental assessment and screening
-   Videofluoroscopic swallowing studies and associated measures
-   Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluations of swallowing and associated measures
-   Other instrumental techniques and measures
-   Dysphagia treatment
-   Patient reported outcome measures

The application can be used when preparing manuscripts for submission, for critical appraisal and review activities, or during study design. Upon completion of the checklist questions, the software will output a report identifying aspects of a manuscript or research study that meet minimum reporting standards as well as aspects where greater detail is needed. Manuscripts are currently in preparation that will further describe the framework and provide examples of its utilization.
