# The FRONTIERS Framework

The newly developed FRONTIERS (**F**ramework for **R**ig**O**r a**N**d **T**ransparency **I**n R**E**sea**R**ch on **S**wallowing) Framework is a tool for dysphagia researchers and research consumers to promote rigor and transparency in study design and reporting, specific to dysphagia research.

This interactive, web-based application has been designed to enhance the accessibility and usability of the FRONTIERS Framework. The application allows clinicians and researchers alike to easily plan for and appraise rigor and transparency in study design and reporting by asking key questions across the following categories:

-   Participants and baseline characteristics
-   Non-instrumental assessment and screening
-   Videofluoroscopic swallowing studies and associated measures
-   Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluations of swallowing and associated measures
-   Other instrumental techniques and measures
-   Dysphagia treatment
-   Patient reported outcome measures

The application can be used when preparing manuscripts for submission, for critical appraisal and review activities, or during study design. Upon completion of the checklist questions, the software will output a report identifying aspects of a manuscript or research study that meet minimum reporting standards as well as aspects where greater detail is needed. Manuscripts are currently in preparation that will further describe the framework and provide examples of its utilization.
